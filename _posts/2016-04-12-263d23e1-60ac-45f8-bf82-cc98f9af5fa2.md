The science of natural change and growth shows that at critical points in the development of anything the rules shift. A tree, for example, as it matures, slows down its_quantitative_growth (height & length) and changes to_qualitative_growth (branches & leaves). It changes its operating model and becomes more integrated into a complex ecosystem. It starts developing deeper relationships with the soil, provides shade, habitat and nourishment to other plants and animals. The tree then goes from an**independent**entity with one purpose --- growing larger, to an**interdependent**one --- developing deeper relationships with its environment.

This process of going from fast growth to stable conditions also happens in social systems. From a tiny startup in stealth mode to an 80+ year old corporation employing more than 300,000 people, these natural patterns are frequently present.
